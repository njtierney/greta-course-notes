## 9-10am

- Acknowledgement of country
- Introductions, [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md)
- Introduction to `greta`
- Setup on Posit cloud
- Installation handling:
  - For those who want to install on their local machine
  - We may need users to use the cloud instance if we run out of time to assist
    with local installation
- Start running through logistic regression code in `penguins.R` on Posit Cloud

## 10am - 10:20am

- Break

## 10:20am - 12pm

- Finish running through logistic regression code in `penguins.R` on Posit Cloud
- Exercises:
  - Add other variables into the model
  - Modify priors
  - Stretch: defining a non-linear/weird model equation
- Live coding: using `greta`'s `calculate()` function to making posterior predictions

## 12pm - 1pm: 

- Lunch break
- Nicks will be around from 12:30 - 1pm to talk

## 1pm - 2:40pm

- Live coding: posterior and prior predictive checking workflow
- Canvas group re. individual analysis needs to discuss
- Running through hierarchical regression code in `advanced-penguins.R`

## 2:40 - 3pm:

 - Break

## 3 - 4:20pm

- Live coding: add hierarchical slopes to `advanced-penguins.R`
- Live coding: use R's formula interface to build design matrices
- Work on individual analyses discussed in previous session

## 4:20 - 4:30pm

- Wrap up and finish
